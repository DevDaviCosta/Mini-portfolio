# MAPADEV WEEK Project: Mini Portfolio

This project was carried out during the **Mapadev Week** event on the channel [Dev em Dobro](https://youtube.com/@DevemDobro), where we learned precious things about web development by building a **mini portfolio** with * *HTML, CSS and JS**.

I wasn't that experienced with **HTML** nor **CSS**, but when you build even a simple project with these twins, it's impossible not to learn something. In my case, I improved a lot in building web pages and today I can solve more complex [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) challenges. You can find these solutions on my profile.

THANK YOU SO MUCH TWINS!!!
